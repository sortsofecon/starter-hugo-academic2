I'm a third-year PhD candidate at Universitat Ramon Llull. My research embraces human development with emphasis on human and economic mobility. Specifically, it spans three aspects: migration, education, and health (COVID-19). To date, I have been a contributor of three research projects, two of which are funded by the EU Horizon. As part of my PhD, I have taught undergraduate Econometrics. During my leisure time, I enjoy reading and writing novels and playing billiards. Traveling the world and pushing the frontiers of knowledge are the coolest things I've ever understood.
