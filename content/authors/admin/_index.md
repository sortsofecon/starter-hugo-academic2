I am an Assistant Professor at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, a joint venture between Xi'an Jiaotong University and the University of Liverpool. Prior to joining XJTLU, I had studied and worked in Shanghai, Germany, Britain, and Barcelona (chronologically), and participated in two Horizon Europe projects. In my leisure time, I enjoy reading and writing novels, as well as playing billiards. Publishing papers is my goal, while seeing my fiction in print is the dream.
