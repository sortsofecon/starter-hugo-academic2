I am a PhD candidate at IQS SM, Universitat Ramon Llull. I come from Shanghai and moved to the EU (Germany, UK & Spain) for studies in 2016. By now I have contributed to two research projects funded, respectively, by the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions and Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities (PI: Octasiano Valerio Mendoza). My research lines include migration and mobility, human development, and COVID-19. Besides research, I also taught undergraduates Econometrics. In my leisure time, I'm fond of reading and writing novels and playing billiards. Cruising around the world and pushing the frontiers of knowledge are the coolest things I can figure out. [News: I am expected to do a research stay at Heidelberg University next semester.]
