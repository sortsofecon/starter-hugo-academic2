I am a PhD candidate at IQS SM, Universitat Ramon Llull. I was born in Shanghai and moved to Europe since 2016. I am hired as a research assistant to Dr. Octasiano Valerio Mendoza, working mainly on a MSCA-funded project. My research lines cover labor migration, child development, human mobility, and COVID-19. I have also taught undergraduates Econometrics. In my leisure time, I'm fond of reading and writing novels and playing billiards. Cruising around the world and pushing the frontiers of knowledge are the coolest things I can figure out.
