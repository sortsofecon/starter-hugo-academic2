I'm a third-year PhD candidate at Ramon Llull University. My research embraces human and economic mobility. I have studied and worked in four countries and been a contributor of two EU Horizon research projects. As part of my PhD, I have tutored and taught undergraduate-level courses. During my leisure time, I enjoy reading and writing novels and playing billiards. Traveling the world and pushing the frontiers of knowledge are the coolest things I've ever understood.
