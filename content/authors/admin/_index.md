I am an Assistant Professor at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. My research basically embraces human development and economic mobility. I have studied and worked in China, Germany, Britain, and Spain, and have participated in two Horizon Europe research projects. In my leisure time, I enjoy reading and writing novels, as well as playing billiards. Publishing papers is my goal, while seeing my fiction in print is the dream.
