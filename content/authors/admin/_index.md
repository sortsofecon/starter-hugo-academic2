I'm an Assistant Professor at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. My research embraces human and economic mobility. I have studied and worked in China, Germany, Britain, and Spain, and contributed to three research projects, two of which are funded by Horizon Europe, the EU's flagship funding program. During my leisure time, I enjoy reading and writing novels and playing billiards. Publishing papers is my goal, while publishing my fiction is the dream.
