I'm a third-year PhD candidate at Universitat Ramon Llull. My research embraces human development with a focus on mobility and/or its relation to COVID-19. I have contributed to two research projects funded, respectively, by the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions and the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities (PI: Dr. Octasiano Valerio Mendoza). As part of my PhD, I have also taught undergraduate Econometrics. During my leisure time, I enjoy reading and writing novels and playing billiards. Traveling the world and pushing the frontiers of knowledge are the coolest things I've ever understood.
