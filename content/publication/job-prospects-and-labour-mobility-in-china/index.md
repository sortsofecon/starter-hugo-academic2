abstract: China's structural changes have brought new challenges to its regional
  employment structures, entailing labour redistribution. Until now, Chinese
  migration research with a forward-looking perspective and on bilateral
  longitudinal determinants at the prefecture city level is almost non-existent.
  This paper investigates the effects of job prospects on individual migration
  decisions across prefecture boundaries. To this end, we created proxy
  variables for wage and employment prospects, introduced reference-dependence
  to a dynamic discrete choice model, and estimated corresponding empirical
  specifications with a unique quasi-panel of 66,427 individuals from 283 cities
  during 1997–2017. To address multilateral resistance to migration resulting
  from the future attractiveness, we exploited various monadic and dyadic fixed
  effects. Multilevel logit models and two-step system GMM estimation were
  adopted for the robustness check. Our primary findings are that a 10% increase
  in the ratio of sector-based employment prospects in cities of destination to
  cities of origin raises the probability of migration by 1.281–2.185 percentage
  points, and the effects tend to be stronger when the scale of the ratio is
  larger. Having a family migration network causes an increase of approximately
  6 percentage points in migratory probabilities. Further, labour migrants are
  more likely to be male, unmarried, younger, or more educated. Our results
  suggest that the ongoing industrial reform in China influences labour mobility
  between cities, providing important insights for regional policymakers to
  prevent brain drain and to attract relevant talent.
